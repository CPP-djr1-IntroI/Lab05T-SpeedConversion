The conversion of kilometers per hour (kph) to miles per hour (mph) is
given by the formula mph = kph \* 0.6214. Write a C++ program in a
project **Speed** that produces a table of conversions based on the
input from the user as in the example below. The speeds are to be shown
in increments of 10 kph and will stop after reaching or exceeding the
ending value. Notice that all numbers are to be printed to the tenths
place.

*** Speed Table ***

Enter starting KPH value: 60
Enter ending KPH value: 100

      KPH      MPH
      ---      ---
     60.0     37.3
     70.0     43.5
     80.0     49.7
     90.0     55.9
    100.0     62.1
</pre>

*** Speed Table ***

Enter starting KPH value: 25.5
Enter ending KPH value: 103

      KPH      MPH
      ---      ---
     25.5     15.8
     35.5     22.1
     45.5     28.3
     55.5     34.5
     65.5     40.7
     75.5     46.9
     85.5     53.1

**Lab 5.2**

Add a project called **Hypotenuse** to your solution that solves the
following problem.
      
Click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle) for information on right-trianble.

A right triangle is a triangle where one of the three
angles is 90 degrees. An interesting trait of a right triangle is the
fact that the squares of the two sides add up to the square of the
hypotenuse, the side opposite the right angle. The hypotenuse is always
the longest of the three sides. For this project, you need to use these
facts to determine if a triangle is a right triangle. You will be given
the length of each side and must determine which side is potentially the
hypotenuse. In the figure **a^2^ + b^2^ = c^2^.**

Sample Output
**To complete this assignment you must submit the following:**

1.  **An electronic Solution of your program on GitHub**

    a.  You are to click on the Lab04 Link on The C++ Tutorials in the section Data Input to accept this
        assignment as we've done before. Once accepted, code up a
        complete solution to each project specified above. Your
        complete solution is to be pushed to GitHub no later than the
        date and time specified above for your specific section. I will
        only grade your solution from the proper location on GitHub.

    b.  Pay attention to the example output above. Your program's output
        must look **exactly** like the example output! The spacing and
        newlines in your output must match exactly.

    c.  Make sure that your program compiles and runs correctly with no
        errors and no warnings. If you get any errors, double check that
        you typed everything correctly. Be aware that C++ is
        case-sensitive.

2.  **An electronic pdf (punetidLab04SpeedOfSound.pdf) 
of your program is to be emailed to ryandj@pacificu.edu**
